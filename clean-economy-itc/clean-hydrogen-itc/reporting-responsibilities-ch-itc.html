		<!-- Second H1 -->
		<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Your reporting responsibilities</h1>
		
		<!-- Page content -->

	<p>You <strong>must</strong> file an annual information report and an annual carbon intensity report.</p> 
	
	  <h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#h-1">Annual information reporting</a></li>
          <li><a href="#h-2">Annual carbon intensity reporting</a></li>

	  <li><a herf ="#h-4"></a>Repaying credit amounts to the CRA</li>	
        </ul>	 
	
	<h2 id="h-1">Annual information reporting</h2>
	<p>File with your annual return of income for each taxation year that begins during the compliance period in respect of the project, information in respect of the operations of the clean hydrogen project, including the first day of hydrogen production, the first day of the compliance period  and any elections to defer the first day of the compliance period.</p>
	
	<h2 id="h-2">Annual carbon intensity reporting</h2>
	<p>If you claimed the Clean Hydrogen ITC for a qualified Clean Hydrogen project, you must file a compliance report with the CRA and NRCan within 180 days after the end of each <mark>operating year (pop-up)</mark> for a project in prescribed form including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <mark>actual carbon intensity (pop-up)</mark> of the hydrogen produced during the operating year</li>
			<li>The kilograms of hydrogen that was produced by the project during the operating year</li>
			<li>Any shutdown time of the project for the year</li>
			<li>For the 5th operating year, the compliance report must include a report that verifies the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced during each operating year of the compliance period, prepared by a <mark>qualified verification (pop-up)</mark> firm for the project </li>
			<li>Any information required in guidelines published by NRCan including the <i>Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit – Validation and Verification Guidance Document</i></li>
		</ul>
<p>Among other things, this information may be relevant to keeping track of when a project shuts down, thereby extending the duration of an operating year and the entire compliance period of the project.</p> 
	
	<h2 id="h-3">Penalty for failure to file annual carbon intensity report</h2>
	<p>If you do not file an annual carbon intensity compliance report for a project, you are liable to a penalty for each report you do not file. The amount will not exceed the total of all clean hydrogen tax credits you deducted in respect of the project.</p>
	<p>For each project, the penalty is calculated as: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>4% of the Clean Hydrogen ITC for the project deducted in a tax year that ended before the deadline to file the compliance report, divided by 365 </li>
			<li>Multiplied by the number of days during which the failure continues</li>
		</ul>

<!--<p><mark>On CCUS, repaying content appears on the How to claim the credit page.</mark></p> -->

	<h2 id="h-4">Repaying credit amounts to the CRA</h2>
	<p>You may have to repay credits amounts you have already received.</p>
	
	<h3>Recovery tax &ndash; change in carbon intensity</h3>
	<p>At the end of the compliance period of a qualified clean hydrogen project, if the average actual carbon intensity is higher than the most recent expected carbon intensity that was used to determine the Clean Hydrogen ITC, you will be subject to recovery tax in the tax year in which the compliance period ends.</p>
	<p>The recovery tax payable is determined by a formula applied to each eligible clean hydrogen property forming part of the project.</p>
	<p>The formula is (A – B) × C, where:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variable A is the specified percentage that was applied to the capital cost of the eligible clean hydrogen property in determining a clean hydrogen tax credit.</li>
		<li>Variable B is the specified percentage that would have applied to the capital cost of the property if the expected carbon intensity were equal to the average actual carbon intensity of the project.</li>
		<li>Variable C is the capital cost of the property on which the clean hydrogen tax credit was deducted</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The recovery tax is zero, if the difference between the average actual carbon intensity and the expected carbon intensity of the project is 0.5 or less. This exception is intended to provide some tolerance and flexibility for variations in a project’s carbon intensity that are unanticipated or outside of your control.</p> 
	<p>NRCan will review each of the compliance reports and the CRA in consultation with NRCan may make a determination or redetermination of the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced in the clean hydrogen project for any operating year during the compliance period of the project.</p> 

	<h3>Interest on recovery tax </h3> 
	<p>For the purpose of applying interest to an amount payable because of a recovery tax ,  your balance-due day for the tax year is deemed to be the balance-due day of the tax year for the related Clean Hydrogen ITC. This may create a liability for interest from the tax year in which the tax credit was originally claimed.</p>

	<h3>Recapture of Clean Hydrogen ITC</h3>  
	<p>If you acquired an eligible Clean Hydrogen property in the year or any of the preceding 20 calendar years, and you became entitled to a  Clean Hydrogen ITC for the capital cost, or a portion of the capital cost, of the property, you will have to calculate a recapture of Clean Hydrogen ITC, if in the tax year:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>you disposed of the property, </li>  
		<li>converted the property to a non-hydrogen or ammonia use, or </li> 
		<li>exported the property from Canada. </li>
	</ul>

  <p>Note:Recapture does not apply on the disposition of a property if the property was previously converted to a non-hydrogen or ammonia use or exported from Canada, which ensures that recapture is not triggered twice for the same property.  </p>

	<p>Where recapture applies in respect of an eligible clean hydrogen property, you must add to the tax otherwise payable for the year the amount determined by the formula (A – B) × (C ÷ D), Where:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Variable A is the amount of your clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of the property.</li> 
		<li>Variable B is the portion of any recovery tax you previously paid in respect of the property.</li> 
		<li>Variable  C is the amount, not exceeding the original capital cost of the property, equal to either the proceeds of disposition of the property or the fair market value of the property, depending on the circumstances. </li> 
		<li>Variable D is the capital cost of the property on which the Clean Hydrogen ITC was deducted.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Election &ndash; sale of clean hydrogen project</h3> 
	<p>You may make an election to avoid the,  under subsection 127.48(23) of the ITA.</p> 
	<p>The election may be available where a qualifying taxpayer (the vendor) disposes of all or substantially all of its properties that are part of a qualified clean hydrogen project of the taxpayer to another taxable Canadian corporation (the purchaser).</p> 
	<p>If this election is made, the purchaser will assume the relevant tax history of the vendor so that recovery and recapture taxes under section 127.48 can apply appropriately.</p> 
	<!--
	<p>Example &ndash; Recovery tax calculation (x/h)</p>
	<p>A taxpayer acquires eligible clean hydrogen property (other than clean ammonia equipment) with a capital cost of $1 million in respect of a qualified clean hydrogen project. In its initial clean hydrogen project plan, the taxpayer had an expected carbon intensity of 0.5, so the taxpayer receives a Clean Hydrogen tax credit equal to $400,000 (40% × $1 million).</p>
	<p>Before the first day of the compliance period, the project undergoes a redesign that results in an expected increase to carbon intensity of more than 0.5, so the taxpayer files a revised clean hydrogen project plan with the Minister of Natural Resources in accordance with subsection 127.48(8). The revised expected carbon intensity is now 1.5, so the taxpayer has an addition to tax equal to $150,000 ((40% – 25%) × $1,000,000) as of the date of filing the revised plan.</p>
	<p>After the compliance period ends, if the average actual carbon intensity ends up being 2.5, the recovery tax under subsection (18) would be $100,000 ((25% – 15%) × $1,000,000).</p>
	<p>End of x/h</p>
	
	<h3>Interest on recovery tax (127.48(29))</h3>
	<p>For the purpose of applying interest to an amount payable because of a recovery tax the balance-due day of a taxpayer for the tax year is deemed to be the balance-due day of the tax year for the related clean CH ITC. This has the potential effect of creating a liability for interest from the tax year in which the tax credit was originally claimed.</p>
	
	<h3>Recapture of CH ITC</h3>
	<p>You will have to calculate a recapture of CH ITC, if you disposed of property, converted it to non-hydrogen or ammonia use, or exported it from Canada, up to 20 years after you earned the credit on the property.</p>
	<p>Where recapture applies in respect of an eligible clean hydrogen property, a taxpayer is required to add to the tax otherwise payable for the year the amount determined by the formula <span class="nowrap">(A – B) × (C ÷ D),</span> where:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variable A is the amount of the taxpayer’s clean hydrogen tax credit in respect of the property</li>
		<li>Variable B is the portion of any recovery tax previously paid by the taxpayer in respect of the property</li>
		<li>Variable C is the amount, not exceeding the original capital cost of the property, equal to either the proceeds of disposition of the property or the fair market value of the property, depending on the circumstances</li>
		<li>Variable D is the capital cost of the property on which the clean hydrogen tax credit was deducted</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Example &ndash; Recapture from sale of property (x/h)</p>
	<p>In 2024, a taxpayer acquires eligible clean hydrogen property (other than clean ammonia equipment) with a capital cost of $1 million in respect of a qualified clean hydrogen project. In its initial clean hydrogen project plan, the taxpayer had an expected carbon intensity of 0.5, so the taxpayer receives a Clean Hydrogen tax credit equal to $400,000 (40% × $1 million).</p>
	<p>When the compliance period ends in 2029, the average actual carbon intensity of the project is 1.5. As a result, the recovery tax under subsection (18) in respect of the project is $150,000 ((40% – 25%) × $1,000,000).</p>
	<p>In 2031, the taxpayer sells an eligible clean hydrogen property from the project to an arm’s-length party for proceeds of $50,000. The original capital cost on acquisition was $100,000.</p>
	<p>Each variable of the formula in subsection (22) would be determined as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Variable A: $400,000 credit × ($100,000 capital cost of the particular property ÷ $1 million total capital cost) = $40,000 credit in respect of the property</li>
		<li>Variable B: $150,000 recovery × ($100,000 capital cost of the particular property ÷ $1 million total capital cost) = $15,000 recovery tax paid in respect of the property</li>
		<li>Variable C: $50,000 proceeds of disposition</li>
		<li>Variable D: $100,000 original capital cost</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Applying the formula in subsection (22), the recapture tax in respect of this property would be equal to ($40,000 – $15,000) × ($50,000 ÷ $100,000) = $12,500.</p>
	<p>Taxpayers and partnerships must report recapture events to the CRA in prescribed form and manner on or before the taxpayer’s filing due-date for the year in which the recapture event occurs or, in the case of a partnership, on or before the day when a return is required by section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations to be filed in respect of the fiscal period of the partnership in which the recapture event occurs.</p> -->
